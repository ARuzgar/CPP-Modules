## RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) Calculator

This is a simple RPN calculator implemented in [programming language]. It allows you to perform mathematical calculations using the Reverse Polish Notation method.

## Features

- Supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Handles both integers and floating-point numbers.
- Provides a stack-based approach for evaluating expressions.

## Getting Started

To get started with the RPN calculator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Compile the source code: `make`
4. Run the calculator: `./RPN`

## Usage

Once the calculator is running, you can enter your mathematical expressions using the RPN notation. For example, to calculate `2 + 3`, you would enter `2 3 +`. Press Enter to evaluate the expression and see the result.

Here are some examples of valid RPN expressions:

- Addition: `2 3 +` (result: 5)
- Subtraction: `5 3 -` (result: 2)
- Multiplication: `2 3 *` (result: 6)
- Division: `6 3 /` (result: 2)
